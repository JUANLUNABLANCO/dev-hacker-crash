1. Statement
Given a list of integers we want to get another list with the square or cube or whatever, passed as a parameter.
That is, if we want the square we will receive a 2, the cube a 3,...
the two lists will have the same length, the first received list will be integers, we don't need to worry about that.

2. Example

const arrayList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

should return a new array like this:

const newArrayList = [2, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100];

3. testing weÂ´ll make
// squared: ([1, 2, 3])**2 => [1*1=1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9]
const arrOne = [1, 2, 3];
const powOne = 2;
const solutionOne = [1, 4, 9];

// cubed: ([4, 5, 6, 13])**3 = [4*4*4=64, 5*5*5=125, 6*6*6= 216, 9*9*9 = 2197]
const arrTwo = [4, 5, 6, 13];
const powTwo = 3;
const solutionTwo = [64, 125, 216, 2197];
